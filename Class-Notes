Allright, this is probably wrong but it's the only place I've found where I can write at will to take notes, so that will be it.
I will be taking notes here to see if it will work.

04/05/2021 - I'm currently on studying Programming Logic with  UNIVESP, a free course from a Brazilian plataform with its roots at UNESP University (I guess)
   	I'm starting today UNIDADE 3 and will be taking notes from this point forward
    3 - Estruturas de decisão (Decision Structures)
    estruturas condicionais Se.., Senão.. e Fim-se
	Following that there is a drawn example of a flowchart about verifying the average grade for a student and cheking if his average grade is >=7 (true=approved; false=notApproved)
	
	Decision structure in JAVA used the command IF
		Pseudocode
			SE (condição) Então
    			{comando(s)}
			Fim-Se
    	JAVA
			if (condição){
    			{comando(s)};
			}
