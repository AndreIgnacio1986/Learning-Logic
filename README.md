# Learning-Logic
It's a repository about me trying to learn Logic and eventually some programming language
//     2023-09-12 UPDATE: Although not as much as I would like, but I continue learning
//     Now I'm back at University and studying "System Analisys and Development" and
//          I have learned C language at what I could say, intermediate level.
